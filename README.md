# Sound Clustering Assignment

## Overview 

This project contains a Jupyter notebook for analyzing and clustering audio data using dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques. The project processes unlabelled audio files, extracts features, and visualizes clusters to evaluate performance.

The notebook performs the following tasks:

- Loads and extracts audio files from a zip file
- Extracts MFCCs as features using the librosa library
- Applies dimensionality reduction with t-SNE and PCA for visualization
- Clusters data using K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms, and evaluates their performance using metrics like silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index
- Visualization of the results using scatter plots

## Results



## Project setup

1. Install dependencies
2. Load the data from the zip file
3. Run the notebook
4. Analyze results
